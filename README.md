# Windows ISO Updater

Automate the process of updating Windows installation media. This PowerShell script takes an official Microsoft ISO, slipstreams the latest cumulative updates directly into the Windows image using DISM, and generates a fresh, fully patched bootable ISO. 

Installing Windows from this updated media saves time by eliminating large post-installation update downloads.

## Key Features

* **Safe Execution**: All operations occur within an isolated temporary directory (`C:\WISO-Work` by default). The host system configuration remains untouched.
* **No Manual ADK Setup Needed**: Automatically fetches a verified copy of `oscdimg.exe` from Microsoft servers to compile the media.
* **Official Sources Only**: Downloads packages directly from Microsoft endpoints over HTTPS.
* **Windows Server Support**: Compatible with Windows Server media, detected automatically from the image.
* **Secure Boot Ready**: Microsoft's signed boot files are kept as they are, so the ISO boots with Secure Boot on ([writing it to USB](docs/usage.md#writing-the-iso-to-a-usb-stick)).
