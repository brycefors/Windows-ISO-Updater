# Copilot instructions for Windows-ISO-Updater

## What this repo is

A single-purpose Windows automation repo. `Windows-ISO-Updater.ps1` downloads a Windows 10 or 11 ISO,
services the images inside it offline with DISM (LCU, .NET, Setup Dynamic Update, optional WinRE), and
recompiles a bootable ISO with `oscdimg.exe`. `Run-Windows-ISO-Updater.bat` is the double-click entry
point, `docs/` is the manual, `Examples/` holds four answer files, `tools/Update-Version.ps1` stamps
versions from a git hook, `tools/Sync-EmbeddedDriverScripts.ps1` re-mirrors the driver payloads into
`Examples/autounattend-ultimate.xml`, and `tools/Test-Dependencies.ps1` checks that the external things
the script pins (oscdimg hash, Fido, the MCT and ADK fwlinks, the Update Catalog HTML) are still valid.

There is no build, no test suite, and no package manifest. The script is the product.

## Finding your way around, read this before searching

`Windows-ISO-Updater.ps1` is around 5,100 lines, roughly 80k tokens. Never read it end to end, and do not
read overlapping chunks hoping to land on the right part.

Start with the one search that returns the whole map:

- `grep_search`, regex `^\s*#region |^function `, include pattern `Windows-ISO-Updater.ps1`

That is about 130 lines and costs roughly 1k tokens, and it lists every region and every function in file
order. Pick the target off that map, then read a bounded range around it. One map plus one targeted read
beats five exploratory searches and is 60 times cheaper than reading the whole file.

Also worth doing:

- Check repository memory first. It already records the traps, the reasons behind past decisions, and the
  shape of the awkward helpers. Add to it whenever something takes more than one attempt to get right.
- Prefer `grep_search` with an include pattern over semantic search. This repo is one big script plus six
  docs, so an exact pattern nearly always wins.
- Do not re-read a region you have already read in this conversation.

## Writing style, applies to everything

**Never use em dashes or semicolons in prose.** This covers documentation, code comments, commit
messages, host output strings, and anything written in chat. Use commas, periods, parentheses, or a
spaced hyphen instead. Rewrite the sentence rather than swapping in one substitute character, so a
paired em dash usually becomes parentheses and a semicolon usually becomes "so", "and", "while", or a
full stop.

Semicolons are fine where they are code, not prose. Leave statement separators, hashtable literals such
as `@{ Description = $Description; Duration = $Elapsed }`, HTML and XML entities, and quoted code
samples inside comments exactly as they are.

Comments explain *why*. Write one short line stating what the code cannot show on its own. Do not
restate the next line, do not narrate the change for a reviewer, and do not add doc comments to code you
did not touch.

The same economy applies to chat replies. Answer the question or state the outcome and stop. Do not recap
edits that are already visible in the diff, do not restate the plan back, and do not list every test that
passed. Explaining a decision earns its words only when the choice was not obvious, for example a tradeoff
taken, a trap avoided, or a root cause worth remembering.

## Hard constraints

- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 is the target.** No ternary `? :`, no `??`, no `?.`, no `-Parallel`, no
  classes, no `Clean` blocks. Test edits with `powershell.exe -NoProfile`, not pwsh 7.
- **5.1 traps already hit in this repo.**
  - `[enum]::TryParse($type, $str, $bool, [ref]$out)` fails to bind. Use `[enum]::Parse` in try/catch.
  - The `string[]` overload of `[datetime]::TryParseExact` fails to bind. Regex-parse `HH:mm` by hand.
  - `@($list)` on a `System.Collections.Generic.List[object]` throws "Argument types do not match".
    Use `.ToArray()`. `List[string]` and ArrayList are fine.
  - `[Parameter(Mandatory)][object[]]` rejects `@()`. Use `[AllowEmptyCollection()]` and drop Mandatory.
  - `Test-Path` and `Get-ChildItem` without `-LiteralPath` treat `[` and `]` as wildcards, so a path
    containing brackets silently matches nothing.
- **`Register-ScheduledTask -Trigger` rejects client-only monthly CIM triggers** with 0x80070057 no
  matter which properties are set. Monthly and Patch Tuesday schedules need an XML round trip. Read the
  `scheduled-task-triggers` skill before touching any of that code, and do not try to fix it inline.
- **Never execute the main script or the answer-file payloads to validate them.** They mount images,
  write to the registry, and register scheduled tasks. Parse instead:
  `[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile($path, [ref]$null, [ref]$errors)`.
  For the XML, load with `[xml]` and run each `//e:File` and `//e:ExtractScript` node through
  `Parser::ParseInput` under the namespace `https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/`.
- **Never hand-edit a version line.** `tools/Update-Version.ps1` owns `# Version:`, `:: Version:`, and
  `$ScriptVersion = '...'`, and the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` hook re-stamps and re-stages them on every
  commit. Versions are CalVer, `yyyy.MM.dd.<rev>`.
- Do not commit, push, or register a real scheduled task without being asked.

## Rebuild-avoidance model

`Stamps\last-build.json` plus `Stamps\History\` record what the last build was made from. `Test-RebuildNeeded`
runs *before* extraction and compares the source ISO SHA-256, the build-affecting parameter set and
answer-file hash, and the newest KBs from the Microsoft Update Catalog, which `Get-ExpectedUpdateSet`
resolves from the stamp so nothing has to be mounted. A catalog that cannot be reached is informational
and must not block. `-AutoClean` deletes only files a stamp recorded.

Keep that ordering. Anything that forces extraction before the decision defeats the whole feature.

## Where the rest of the rules live

Domain rules are scoped to the files they govern so they only load when they apply. Do not copy them
back into this file.

| Scope | File |
| --- | --- |
| PowerShell layout, output colors, post-edit parse and region check | `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md` |
| The `Examples/` answer files and their parse-only validation | `.github/instructions/answer-files.instructions.md` |
| `README.md` and `docs/` ownership and house style | `.github/instructions/documentation.instructions.md` |
| Monthly and Patch Tuesday trigger registration | `.github/skills/scheduled-task-triggers/SKILL.md` |

Commit messages are a single imperative sentence, for example "Add logging for Microsoft Update Catalog
query results".
