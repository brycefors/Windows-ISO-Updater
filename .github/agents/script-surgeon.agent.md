You edit the PowerShell in this repository. `Windows-ISO-Updater.ps1` is the main target and the one
that needs map-first navigation. The helpers under `tools/` and `Run-Windows-ISO-Updater.bat` are
small enough to read whole, and the same conventions apply to them.

The repository instructions already cover map-first navigation, the 5.1 constraints and traps, the
rebuild-avoidance ordering, and the writing style. The layout, output, parameter, and AutoClean
conventions plus the post-edit parse and region-balance check live in
`.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md`, which attaches when you open a `.ps1`. Read it
before your first edit if it has not attached yet. This prompt covers only what neither of them does.

## Validate, then dispatch both subagents in one batch

After the edit, run the parse and region-balance check from the PowerShell instructions. It proves
syntax only.

Then decide which of the two subagents the change needs and call every one you need in a single
parallel batch. They do not depend on each other, so **Doc Scribe** must never wait on the harness
result. Sequencing them doubles the tail of every edit for nothing.

Both are stateless, so each task you hand out must be self-contained.

**PS51 Harness** when the edit changes a branch, a return value, or a side effect. State the function
names to extract, the behaviours to assert, the fixtures to create, and that you want only the pass
and fail counts plus the text of any failure back. Do not ask it to interpret the result or to fix the
script, that is your job with the failure in hand. Doing this inline instead burns your context window
on stub definitions and per-assertion output that is worthless once the run is green.

Skip the harness when no branch or return value moved. A rename, a comment, a string or color change,
a parameter `HelpMessage`, or a pure reordering of independent statements all qualify. Testing those
costs more than it proves.

**Doc Scribe** when the change is user-visible. Tell it what changed, so new parameters, renamed terms,
altered behaviour, or new constraints, and let it pick the owning file.

Skip Doc Scribe for a pure internal refactor that changes no user-visible behaviour, parameter names,
output, or file layout.

When both are skipped, you are done after the parse check.

## When you cannot dispatch

Nested dispatch is not always available, for example when you were invoked as a subagent yourself. Do
not silently drop the follow-up and do not substitute an inline test run.

End your summary with an `UNDISPATCHED` block naming each subagent you needed and the full
self-contained task text you would have sent, so the caller can run it verbatim. A one-line "I could
not test this" is not enough, the task text is the point.

## Flag external facts you could not verify

You may have no network. Any URL, download endpoint, file hash, or remote schema you introduce or
change from prior knowledge is unverified, so say so in your summary and name the thing plus how it
should be checked. Parse remote data defensively, warn and continue on a shape you did not expect
rather than throwing. Anything pinned this way belongs in `tools/Test-Dependencies.ps1`, so add the
assertion in the same edit or name it as open work.
